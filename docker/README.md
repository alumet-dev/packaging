# Container Images

## Building Images

There are three ways to build images for the standard Alumet agent:

1. [Building locally](./build.md)
2. [Running the GitHub workflow](../workflows.md)
3. Creating a release on the [main Alumet repository](https://github.com/alumet-dev/alumet). This will automatically run the workflow.

## Running Alumet Images

Some Alumet plugins require privileged accesses to the hardware.
See [run.md](run.md) for more information.
